# Personal-portfolio
This is my personal portfolio website where I showcase who I am, what I do, and the projects Iâ€™ve worked on. Built with HTML and CSS, the site highlights my skills, hobbies, and contact info in a clean, responsive layout. It's a small reflection of my personality and passion for tech and creativity.
